			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I was introduced to David Hilbert’s famous quote at a very young age – 
      “A mathematical theory is not considered complete until you have made it so clear that you can explain it to the 
      first person you meet on the street”. And it has stuck with me as a part of my life ever since, improving me as a student, 
      as an engineer and as a person.</p>

      <p>Extremely inquisitive by nature, I kept the words ‘why’ and ‘how’ handy throughout my life, using them judiciously to 
      question my doubts which have always resulted in impressive solutions helping me hone my skills as an innovator and an 
      engineer. It was this nature of mine that saw magic in the world of Artificial Intelligence, helping me cement my decision 
      to pursue my masters degree in the same domain.</p>
      
      <p>The art of developing systems that can learn, predict and improve using Statistics, Data analysis and Programming
      fascinates me a lot. Currently pursuing my masters degree at North Carolina State University, I am working on various 
      projects related to Computer Vision, Deep Learning and Machine Learning.

      Doing an independent research study under Dr Tianfu Wu helped me garner a lot of practical knowledge in Deep learning. 
      Along with his guidance, I developed an online video tracking model using a Siamese Convolutional Neural Network 
      with a deformable part based approach. </p>

      <p>Presently, I am doing a summer internship at The Jackson Laboratory as a Computational Sciences and Deep Learning 
      summer intern.  I am actively looking for full time positions in the field of Compuer Vision, Deep Learning and 
      Machine Learning.</p>
